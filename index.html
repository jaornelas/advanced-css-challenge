        <div>   
        <p class="content-box">My name is Jose and I am from Madison, WI. I have lived in this state for a majority of my life
            and am looking forward to expanding my programming knowledge. I currently work in finance for a local 
            credit union as a financial mentor and have been doing this for 6 years. My goal is to move into their 
            Internet Services department after completion of this class. 
        <br></br>
        In my spare time I enjoy being outdoors and going on hikes or going camping. I also enjoy playing videogames
            and reading books. I am currently reading The Parabal of the Sower by Octavia Butler. Some of the games I am currently working
            on completing are The Witcher 3 and Horizon Forbidden West. Aside from this, I enjoy cooking meals with my partner and doing
            puzzles together.
